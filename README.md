# multiversal go
a phext-native version of go

In multiversal go, you can choose to play normally, or you can split the board with your stone. This allows the game to expand rapidly from single player to multiple players.

The initial board size is used as the expansion parameter.

## Gameplay

Board coordinates are numbered in planes. On a 9x9 grid, the coordinate z=2, x=1, y=1 refers to the 1,1 point on the second board.
